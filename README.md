# Fourier-Series-Shape-Analysis-Fibroblasts
Shape analysis of two-dimensional fibroblast shapes using Fourier Series and Principal Component Analysis. This minimum working example is based on work from: https://www.palass.org/publications/newsletter/palaeomath-101/palaeomath-part-25-centre-cannot-hold-ii-elliptic-fourier-analysis.

This minimum working example reproduces shape analysis of fibroblast cells as done in our pre-print here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.594418v1.abstract.

To run this example, download all files and keep them all in the same directory or folder. Simply open MAIN.m in Matlab, press Run, and make sure you change the current directory to the directory containg the code and Excel file. The code should visualize eigenshapes along principal axes 1-3 and export them as .png images.
