# Fourier-Series-Shape-Analysis-Fibroblasts
Shape analysis of two-dimensional fibroblast shapes using Fourier Series and Principal Component Analysis. This minimum working example is based on work from: https://www.palass.org/publications/newsletter/palaeomath-101/palaeomath-part-25-centre-cannot-hold-ii-elliptic-fourier-analysis.

To run this example, download all files and keep them all in the same directory or folder. Simply open the .m file inside the folder that has the same name as the folder (e.g., 'segmentation_fourier_series_fit_DOA.m') in Matlab, press Run, and make sure you change the current directory to the directory containg the code and Excel data file. 

This minimum working example reproduces shape analysis of fibroblast cells as done in our pre-print here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.594418v1.abstract. In general, 


Please note that the magnitudes of PC axes 1 and 3 were flipped for visual effect in the pre-print. This does not change the meaning of the axes.
